# Amplify Trip Experience - Flutter Mobile App

## Overview

This how-to guide, split into two parts, focuses on creating a cross-platform Flutter mobile app using AWS Amplify. The app, a trip planner, allows users to create trips with details such as name, destination, and dates, along with the ability to upload a banner image.

The second guide in the series introduces new features, including adding activities to trips using a nested data model and creating user profiles with an Amplify function.

## What You Will Accomplish

You will:

- Create a Flutter app using the terminal and organize it using the Feature-First approach.
- Use Amplify CLI to create the backend for this app.
- Add Amplify authentication and use the Amplify Authenticator UI library.
- Create a data model for trips and synchronize it with the Amplify backend using GraphQL API.
- Enable users to upload images for their trips with Amplify storage.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account. Follow the [Setting Up Your AWS Environment](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/) tutorial.
- Install and configure the [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/).
- Install and configure [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- A text editor (VSCode is used in this guide) combined with Flutter’s command-line tools.
